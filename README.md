1. **Employers** sign up, create payrolls, and deposit funds.
2. **Employees** accept invitations, track payments, and withdraw to wallets.
3. Smart contracts handle recurring or one-time payments.
4. Payroll funds can be optionally parked in DeFi for earnings before payout.
5. All payments are recorded immutably on-chain for transparency.
